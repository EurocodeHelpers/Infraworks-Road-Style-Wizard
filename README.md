# Infraworks-Road-Style-Wizard

An (unofficial) program developed in C# that helps Autodesk Infraworks (IW) users mass-produce road cross-sections without relying on the cumbersome manual
process using IW's GUI. 

The program allows users to specify road cross-sections either via the GUI tabular input or direct import via an Excel file. 
The program then produces a styles.json file which can be readily imported into Infraworks. 

Please refer to the included manual for a ful description on how to use the program. If the tool is of interest please do a test-run on 
a new/non-project critical model to satsify yourself that the tool is up to the job. The tool went quite a bit of testing via randomly
generated road-cross-sections but of course accidents do happen...

Note: The program has only been tested on IW 2019 and 2020.

It should go without saying, but the LSP is not endorsed by Autodesk!

Happy modelling!
