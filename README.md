# Infraworks Road Style Wizard

A simple application for Infraworks (IW) that:

1. Provides a method to create road-styles using a tabular interface
2. Allows sharing road style templates between models.

Hopefully this application will help IW modellers reduce the amount of time spent manually creating road-sections using the cumbersome GUI

Please refer to the included manual for a full description on how to use the program included worked examples. 

Although the application underwent a lot of testing, It is strongly recommended that users of the program do a test-run on a non-critical model file to satisfy themselves that the tool works as described.  

The program has only been tested on IW 2019 and 2020.

If you have any feedback, find any bugs or have suggestions for future improvements drop me a line at support@eurocodehelpers.com 

It should go without saying, but the wizard is not endorsed by Autodesk!
